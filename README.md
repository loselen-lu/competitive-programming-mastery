# Competitive Programming Mastery: 100 Problems

This repository documents my journey through a curated list of 100 competitive programming problems, designed to take me from beginner to advanced level. Problems are organized by topic to progressively build deep understanding and skill.

---

## How to Use This Repository

1. **Follow the Order:** The problems are arranged by topic, from fundamentals to advanced.
2. **The Process:**
   * Try hard to solve each problem (1–2 hours)
   * If stuck, learn the underlying concept (e.g., "binary search on answer")
   * Code the solution from understanding, not copying
   * If needed, read others' solutions, then reimplement from scratch
3. **Language:** All problems are solved in C++
4. **Platform:** Codeforces, AtCoder, SPOJ, CSES, and others
